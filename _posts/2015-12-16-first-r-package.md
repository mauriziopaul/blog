title:  "Embarking On My First R Package"

Using a simple checklist of [data analysis procedures][dat-procs] for building R packages, via to the GitHub [site][rdpeng-github] of Roger Peng, biostatistics faculty at [Johns Hopkins][rdpeng-jhsph], I have been able to put together the framework for a minimal R package, which still needs to be developed a bit. The package contains functions, loaded from a source file, which are useful for analyzing data sets for two projects on the genetics of infectious disease which I have been working on. This will both help to standardize and streamline my work on both of the projects, but also enable me to share my code in a more easily accessible format with others when the papers are being published.

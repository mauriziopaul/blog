Using a simple checklist of [data analysis procedures][dat-procs] for building R packages, via to the GitHub [site][rdpeng-github] of Roger Peng, biostatistics faculty at [Johns Hopkins][rdpeng-jhsph], I have been able to put together a minimal package framework. The package contains functions, loaded from a source file, which are useful for analyzing data sets for two projects on the genetics of infectious disease which I have been working on. Having this package will help me standardize and streamline my own work on both of the projects, while also preparing my functions and code to be shared with others in a more easily accessible format, either on GitHub or via [CRAN][cran], the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

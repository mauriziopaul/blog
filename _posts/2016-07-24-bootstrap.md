While I have been using Jekyll for a few months now, I am running into some very nice website designs that require some fiddling with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), a popular framework for website development (mobile-friendly/mobile-first).

## Bootstrap

Here are some of my notes on learning Bootstrap:

* There is a CodeSchool course on this [here](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/blasting-off-with-bootstrap/).
* The purpose of this framework is to simplify the process of working with HTML, CSS, and JS files simultaneously.
* It assists with quick styling and organizing, reducing the amount of CSS and JS meddling you have to do to get a website up and running.
* It is popular, for example, see [Lyft](http://www.lyft.com), and Apple [Maps Connect](https://mapsconnect.apple.com).
* It can be used for [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) web design.

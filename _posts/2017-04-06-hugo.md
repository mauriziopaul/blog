## Hugo

In order to develop a software website for my manuscript, in revision, I am attempting to follow quick start instructions to create a Hugo website, here: [hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/).

I am also interested in the [Aerial] theme, which is described here: [Aerial](http://themes.gohugo.io/aerial/).
